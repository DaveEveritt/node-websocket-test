# I have literally NO IDEA what I'm doing here

One day, I pondered, "I'll find some code that provides a simple WebSockets example to experiment with." But HAHAHABOOHOO no such joy after three days of unalloyed misery.

**WANTED:** a simple working example (for all modern browsers) and - yes, I'm looking at *YOU*, you… WebSocket blog article writers - **without** socket.io (for now at least), Express, JQuery and other black-box baggage…

This is a total mess. See if you can make it not a mess.
