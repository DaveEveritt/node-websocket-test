# I have literally NO IDEA what I'm doing here

One day, I pondered, "I'll find some code that provides a simple WebSockets example to experiment with." But HAHAHABOOHOO no such joy after three days of unalloyed misery.

I journeyed through 5 tutorials, innumerable [StackOverflow questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6084360/using-node-js-as-a-simple-web-server), and searched for error strings that proved to me EVERYONE AND HIS PIGGIN' DOG has the same problem and the same error string.

I even put a [WebSocket question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41429510/cannot-find-an-answer-to-fix-issue-with-websocket-connection-closing) which - as is sadly often the case these days - NO-ONE has answered. Cry.

**WANTED:** a simple working example (for all modern browsers) and - yes, I'm looking at *YOU*, you… WebSocket blog article writers - **without** socket.io (for now at least), Express, JQuery and other black-box baggage…

This is a total mess. See if you can make it not a mess.
