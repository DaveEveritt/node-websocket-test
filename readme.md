# Simple WebSocket example

A simple working example (for all modern browsers) and - yes, I'm looking at *YOU*, you… WebSocket blog article writers - **without** socket.io (for now at least), Express, JQuery and other black-box baggage…

Clone/download, then run from the command-line by changing directories to "node-websocket-test", typing `node server.js` and visiting "localhost:8080" in a browser.

After much hacking and failing, [Phil](https://github.com/inphode) fixed this so it actually works (thanks!). Here's the original [WebSocket question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41429510/cannot-find-an-answer-to-fix-issue-with-websocket-connection-closing) which - as is sadly often the case these days - has had no answers. So I'll probably go and answer it myself at some point.
